# Functional and Logical Programming with Prolog

## Overview

This repository covers the fundamentals of functional and logical programming languages, with a focus on Prologâ€”a language that combines logical and functional programming aspects similar to Java. The study employs a multi-paradigm approach, incorporating object-oriented, functional, and logic programming paradigms, to depict statistical data related to confirmed COVID-19 cases, death cases, and recovered cases.

## Programming Approach

The study explores programming concepts related to functional composition and purity. It introduces a knowledgebase file that includes facts and rules, allowing the arrangement of COVID-19 data in ascending and descending order of confirmed cases.

## Features

- Utilizes a multi-paradigm approach, incorporating object-oriented, functional, and logic programming.
- Implements Prolog rules for problem-solving based on basic information.
- Leverages list comprehension, recursion, and higher-order functions for various features.
- Implements a text-based menu system for handling functions using recursion.

## Prolog Rules

The Prolog rules developed in this study focus on solving problems based on a set of basic information. The rules make use of list comprehension, recursion, and higher-order functions to enhance functionality.

## Text-Based Menu

To facilitate user interaction, a text-based menu is implemented to handle various features. The menu system is designed using recursion to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## How to Use

To explore the functionalities and Prolog rules, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your_repository`
3. Execute the Prolog program: `<command_to_run_program>`
4. Follow the on-screen menu instructions to interact with different features.
